In order to build gtest 1.7.0 using VS2017, please extract the files in
the supplied solution and project files in VS2017_Project_Files.zip file.

The files should be extracted , which should be extracted into a new
folder: ..\msvc15#" in the root of the gtest 1.7.0 folder.

Once the corresponding solution (gtest.sln) in this new folder has been opened
with VS2017, for each of Debug/Release and x86/x64 combinations (4 in total) -
right click on the gtest project and select "Project Only->Rebuild Only gtest".
Do the same for gtest_main project selecting "Project Only->Rebuild Only gtest_main".

This will create the necessary libraries in directory "build-vc15" in the root
of the gtest 1.7.0 folder.

NOTE: Password Safe does not use the other two projects gtest_prod_test and gtest_unittest
and they do NOT have to be built.
