In order to build gtest 1.7.0 using VS2017, please extract the files in
the supplied solution and project files in VS2017_Project_Files.zip file.

The files should be extracted into a new folder: "VC15" in the
"..\xerces-c-3.1.4\projects\Win32" folder.

Once the corresponding solution (xerces-all.sln) in the subdirectory xerces-all
of this new folder has been opened with VS2017, for each of "Static Debug" and
"Static Release" and x86/x64 combinations (4 in total) - right click on the
XercesLib project and select "Project Only->Rebuild Only XercesLib".

This will create the necessary libraries in directory "Build" in the root
of the Xerces 3.1.4 folder.

NOTE: Password Safe does NOT use any of the other projects or configurations
and they do NOT have to be built.

It is suggested that 2 new folders in a new "Xerces" folder.  These will be:
"xerces-c-3.1.4-x86-windows-vc-15.0" and "xerces-c-3.1.4-x86_64-windows-vc-15.0".
These will match the default generated by "configure-15.vbs" script, although
their location may be different.

These should each contain a copy of the "include" folder in the Xerces distribution and
a "lib" folder.  Within the "lib" folder, copy or move the ".lib" and ".pdb" files just
generated in the "..\xerces-c-3.1.4\Build\Win32\VC150" and "..\xerces-c-3.1.4\Build\Win64\VC150"
folders.  The Release and Debug versions should be copied into the same target folders.

The files are:
Debug x86 & x64
  xerces-c_static_3D.lib
  xerces-c_static_3D.pdb

Release x86 & x64
  xerces-c_static_3.lib
  xerces-c_static_3.pdb
