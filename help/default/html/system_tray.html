<p>The <b>System Tray</b> context menu gives access to recently used entries (if the
database is unlocked) and to unlock the database if locked. It can also minimize
the main <b>PasswordSafe</b> window and restore it if already minimized but
not locked.</p>

<h3>Set Database ID</h3>

<p>If you regularly have a number of databases open, after opening a database, you may
set a unique temporary ID (a number between 1 and 99) that will be superimposed on top of
the System Tray icon. Setting an ID of zero will free up the previous ID and 
remove the number from this image.</p>

<p>An ID is reserved once assigned to an open database but will be free to be used again
either when a new ID is assigned or the database is closed. In addition, the System Tray
tooltip has been enhanced to show this ID and make the text multiline to display the database name.

<br>
<br>

Notes:
<ul>
<li>An ID can only be assigned to an opened database. When the database is closed, the ID
is free to be assigned to another open database.</li>
<li>An ID can't be assigned to two opened databases at the same time.</li>
<li>The database index can only be changed if the database is unlocked.</li>
<li>The association of an ID to a particular database is not persistent (remembered) and
must be reassigned to a database every time it is opened.</li>
<li>Due to the changes made by Microsoft to the color of the Windows Taskbar and Notification
Area between releases of Windows and the ability using some applications to change this color,
a limited number of text colors for the ID are provided to enable the user to select the best
visible for their environment.</li>
<li>In the enhanced tooltip, if the database is locked, the database name will be shown between
square brackets as shown below.</li>
</ul>
